I first came across _Eric Hoffer_ by accident at the library, and the more I
learned about him, the more curious I became. He wasn't a professor or an
academic. In fact, he was a self-taught philosopher who spent most of his life
working odd jobs (and somehow I related to him).

For many years, he was a part-time dock worker, because it gave him enough
free time to read and write.

What fascinated me most was his early life. At just 7 years old, he went blind
after falling down the stairs while his mother was holding him. He stayed
blind until the age of 15, when his eyesight suddenly came back. Afraid he
might lose it again, he began reading compulsively, and never stopped.

_The True Believer_ is one of his most known works, and it explores how mass
movements are formed and why people get pulled into them. Here are some notes
and thoughts I had while reading:

### It's me, it's you

One of the main ideas in The True Believer is that people are often drawn to
mass movements not because of the cause itself, but because of something
missing in their own lives. could be because of economic hardship, social
frustration, or just a personal sense of not fitting in. In these situations,
the movement becomes a kind of escape, or even a new identity.

Movements give people a sense of belonging and purpose, something bigger than
themselves to be part of.

### The charismatic leader

Mass movements often rise around strong, charismatic leaders, people who can
inspire and bring others together with big promises and simple answers. These
leaders know how to speak to people's fears.

The success of a mass movement depends on its ability to create a sense of
unity and purpose among its followers, as well as to provide a clear target
for their anger and frustration.

### Black-and-white view of the world

Mass movements often offer a very clear and simple view of the world
_black-and-white_, with no shades of grey. This way of thinking can feel
comforting, especially in times of crisis, when people are looking for clear
answers.

For example, in communism, the bourgeois class was seen as the enemy, the
source of all problems.

This is dangerous because everything is already decided: who is good, who is
bad, and what must be done. It removes the need for personal responsibility.
Most people find comfort in this kind of certainty, it feels like a relief
when the world/life seems too complex.

### Mass movements can be positive

Mass movements can be both positive and negative, it all depends on their
beliefs and how they try to reach their goals. Not all movements are built on
hate or violence.

Gandhi led a mass movement in India based on nonviolence and civil
disobedience. His goal wasn't to destroy an enemy, but to push for freedom and
justice without losing humanity.

### Movements move us

Understanding why people are attracted to mass movements helps us see how
social and political change happens. It also helps us notice when something
might be going too far, when a movement starts to threaten personal freedom
and the ability to think for ourselves.
